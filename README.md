# Fast Fibonacci Calculator

A blazingly fast command-line Fibonacci calculator using matrix exponentiation.

This project was inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzT9I1d-LlQ).  
I created it to explore Rust's capabilities and, admittedly, to flex a bit!



## Features

- Computes Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation.
- Supports large Fibonacci numbers with blazing speed.
- Provides options to display calculation time and detailed help.

## Installation

cargo install blazing_fibonacci


## Usage



To install the calculator, use the following command:

blazing_fibonacci 1000           # Calculate the 1000th Fibonacci number

blazing_fibonacci -n 1000 -p     # Calculate and print the full number

blazing_fibonacci -n 1000 -t     # Show the calculation time

blazing_fibonacci -h             # Show help and usage instructions
